"""
    TERNARY SEARCH
    Time Complexity: O(log3 N)
    Working: Similar to binary search but here we have two searc point (mid)
    Steps:
        1. Compare with elements at mid1 and mid2. Stop if found
        2. If more than mid1 and less than mid2 - working field is the second part
        3. If less than mid1 - working field is the first part
        4. If more than mid2 - working field is the third part
